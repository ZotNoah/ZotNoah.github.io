            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>As a lead I have learned valuable skills required for any collabortive position. Some of the biggest skills I've learned as a lead are delegation, safety, difficult conversations, project management/improvement, coaching, accountability, staff engagement, and staff development. I work with supervisors and managers to complete daily tasks and ensure that operations are being completed safely and efficiently. When needed I answer phone calls to help assist other departments based on their needs. If I am not able to help answer questions on a phone call I make sure to get in contact with someone that can.</p><br>

            <p>Through my experience at Metro Community College I have acquired many skills in IT. I have a strong understanding of HTML & CSS, followed by the basics of JavaScript. During my time at MCC I have learned the fundamentals of Java, SQL and have had some experience in React. I have also taken classes that have covered IT troubleshooting, Command Prompt, Cyber Security and Bootstrap. Although I have taken a wide variety of class in IT, my main focus is in Front-end Web Development.</p>
